## 🌟 Project Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end **stock market forecasting system** using advanced **time series models**.  
We integrated both classical and deep learning techniques into a unified platform with **interactive dashboards**.

### 🧪 Models Implemented

- 🔢 **ARIMA** – For stationary series and short-term predictions  
- 🔁 **SARIMA** – For data with seasonal patterns  
- 🔮 **Prophet** – For flexible trend and seasonality modeling  
- 🧬 **LSTM** – For long-term and non-linear deep learning forecasting

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, Streamlit, TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Libraries Used**:
  - 📦 `pandas`, `numpy`, `yfinance`
  - 📊 `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `seaborn`
  - ⚙️ `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `prophet`
  - 🤖 `tensorflow`, `keras`
